=== Organizing your Backbone.js code in a Rails app

When using Backbone.js in a Rails app, you'll have two primary kinds of Backbone.js-related assets: classes, and templates.

=== Rails 3.0 and prior

With Rails 3.0 and prior, store your Backbone.js classes in +public/javascripts+:

--------------------------------------
public/
  javascripts/
    jquery.js
    jquery-ui.js
    models/
      user.js
      todo.js
    routers/
      users_router.js
      todos_router.js
    views/
      users/
        users_index.js
        users_new.js
        users_edit.js
      todos/
        todos_index.js
--------------------------------------

If you are using templates, we prefer storing them in +app/templates+ to keep them separated from the server views:

--------------------------------------
app/
  views/
    pages/
      home.html.erb
      terms.html.erb
      privacy.html.erb
      about.html.erb
  templates/
    users/
      index.jst
      new.jst
      edit.jst
    todos/
      index.jst
      show.jst
--------------------------------------

On Rails 3.0 and prior apps, we use Jammit for packaging assets and precompiling templates:

==== A note on JSTs and Jammit

As applications are moving to Rails 3.1, they're also moving to Sprockets for the asset packager.  Until then, many apps are using Jammit for asset packaging.  One issue with Jammit we've encountered and worked around is that the JST template path can change when adding new templates.  We have an open issue and workaround:

=== Rails 3.1

Rails 3.1 introduces the asset pipeline:

http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html

which uses the Sprockets library for preprocessing and packaging assets:

http://getsprockets.org/

To take advantage of the built-in asset pipeline, organize your Backbone.js templates and classes in paths available to the asset pipeline.  Classes go in +app/assets/javascripts/+, and templates go alongside, in +app/assets/templates/+:

--------------------------------------
app/
  assets/
    javascripts/
      jquery.js
      models/
        todo.js
      routers/
        todos_router.js
      views/
        todos/
          todos_index.js
    templates/
      todos/
        index.jst.ejs
        show.jst.ejs
--------------------------------------

Using Sprockets' preprocessors, we can use templates as before.  Here, we're using the EJS template preprocessor to provide the same functionality as Underscore.js' templates.  It compiles the +*.jst+ files and makes them available to the +window.JST+ function.  Identifying the +.ejs+ extension and invoking EJS to compile the templates is managed by Sprockets, and requires the +ejs+ gem to be included in the application Gemfile.
