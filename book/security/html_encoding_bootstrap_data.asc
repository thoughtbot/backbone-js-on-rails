=== Encoding data when bootstrapping JSON data

As it turns out, bootstrapping JSON data in your erb templates introduces a
security vulnerability. Consider the case when a user enters a malicious
+<script>+ as the title of a task. When the tasks#index page is reloaded,
and we naively bootstrap task data on the page, the browser will interpret
and execute the script. Since it's possible for this script to run on another
user's session, it can be quite damaging if it goes on to, for exmple, edit
or destroy the user's data.

To protect against this, we make use of the fact that on HTML5 documents,
script tags that do not have a type of +text/javascript+ won't be automatically
evaluated by the browser. Therefore we can create an element with the
HTML-encoded bootstraped data enclosed in a script of type +text/json+, fetch
it using a simple jquery selector, and parse it ourselves.

Here's an example:

[javascript]
source~~~~
<script type="text/json" id="bootstrap">
  { "tasks": <%= @tasks.to_json %> }
</script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  $(function () {
    var json_div       = document.createElement('div');
    json_div.innerHTML = $('#bootstrap').text();
    var data           = JSON.parse(json_div.innerHTML);
    ExampleApp.init(data);
  });
</script>
source~~~~

A reliable way to unencode the HTML-encoded JSON string is to use the
browser's native functionality, by retreiving a element's +innerHTML+.
So in the above script, we create a +json_div+ element, assign its
+innerHTML+ to the bootstrap script's text, and retreive back out,
unencoded. The final result is the +data+ variable containing proper JSON
that can be parsed and passed along to your app's init function.

This approach can be seen on the example app on the
+app/views/tasks/index.html.erb+ template
