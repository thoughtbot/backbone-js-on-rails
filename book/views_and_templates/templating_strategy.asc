=== Templating strategy (stub)

There's no shortage of templating options for JavaScript.

A whole bunch of "micro" templating libraries:
http://microjs.com/#templating

They generally fall into three categories:

* HTML with JavaScript expressions interpolated.  Examples: `_.template`, EJS.
* HTML with other expressions interpolated, often logic-free.  Examples: mustache, handlebars, `jQuery.tmpl`
* Selector-based content declarations.  Examples: PURE, just using jQuery from view classes.

=== Choosing a strategy

Like any technology choice, there are tradeoffs to evaluate and external forces
to consider when choosing a templating approach.

The scenarios we've encountered usually involve weighing these questions: do I already have server-side templates written that I'd like to "Backbone-ify," or am I writing new Backbone functionality from scratch?

TODO: flesh this out a bit, or cut the "Choosing a strategy" section entirely

==== When you are adding Backbone to existing Rails views

If you are replacing existing Rails app pages with Backbone, you are already using a templating engine, and it's likely ERb.  When making the switch to Backbone, change as few things as possible at a time, and stick with your existing templating approach.

If you're using ERb, give `_.template` a shot.  It defaults to the same delimiters as ERb for interpolation and evaluation, `<%= %>` and `<% %>`, which can be a boon or can be confusing.  If you'd like to change them, you can update `.templateSettings` - check the underscore docs.

If you're using Haml, check out the `jquery-haml` and `haml-js` projects.

If you're using Mustache.rb or Handlebars.rb, you're likely aware that JavaScript implementations of these both exist, and that your existing templates can be moved over much like the ERb case.

==== When you are writing new Backbone functionality from scratch

If you're not migrating from (or re-using) existing server-side view templates,
you have more freedom of choice.  Strongly consider the option of no templating
at all, but rather using plain HTML templates, and then decorating the DOM from
your view class.

You can build static HTML mockups of the application first, and pull these
mockups directly in as templates, without modifying them.

<div id="song-player">
  <nav>
    <a class="home"    href="#/">Home</a>
    <a class="profile" href="/profile.html">My Profile</a>
  </nav>
  <h2>Song title</h2>

  <audio controls="controls">
    <source src="/test.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
  </audio>

[javascript]

MyView = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: function() {
    this.renderTemplate();
    this.fillTemplate();
  },

  renderTemplate: function() {
    $(this.el).html(JST['songs/index']();
  },

  fillTemplate: function() {
    this.$('nav a.profile').text(App.currentUser().fullName());
    this.$('h2').text(this.model.escape('title'));

    var audio = this.$('audio');
    audio.empty();
    this.model.formats.each(function(format) {
      $("<source></source>")
        .attr("src",  format.get('src'))
        .attr("type", format.get('type'))
        .appendTo(audio);
    });
  }
});

You can see an example of this in the example application's `TaskItem` view
class, at `app/assets/javascripts/views/task_item.js`.
