=== Mixins

Backbone provides a basic mechanism for inheritance.  Often you'll want to build a collection of related, reusable behavior and include that in several classes that already inherit from a Backbone base class.  In these cases, you'll want to use a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin[mixin].

Backbone includes http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Events[Backbone.Events] as an example of a mixin.

Here, we create a mixin named +Observer+ that contains behavior for binding to events in a fashion that can be cleaned up later:

[javascript]
source~~~~
var Observer = {
  bindTo: function(source, event, callback) {
    source.bind(event, callback, this);
    this.bindings = this.bindings || [];
    this.bindings.push({ source: source, event: event, callback: callback });
  },

  unbindFromAll: function() {
    _.each(this.bindings, function(binding) {
      binding.source.unbind(binding.event, binding.callback);
    });
    this.bindings = [];
  }
};
source~~~~

We can mix +Observer+ into a class by using Underscore's +_.extend+ on the prototype of that class:

[javascript]
source~~~~
SomeCollectionView = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  initialize: function() {
    this.bindTo(this.collection, "change", this.render);
  },

  leave: function() {
    this.unbindFromAll(); // calling a method defined in the mixin
    this.remove();
  }
});

_.extend(SomeCollectionView.prototype, Observer);
source~~~~
