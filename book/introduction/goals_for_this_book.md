## Goals for this book

This book aims to cover topics that are of interest when integrating
Backbone into a Rails application.  The primary Backbone documentation is
quite good, and concisely readable.  While we'll touch on introductory
topics when they are critical to understand the points at hand, this book does
not aim to provide an introduction to Backbone, and generally assumes the reader can
lean on the Backbone documentation to explain the details of some concepts.

This book also does not aim to provide a comprehensive mapping of all possible
solutions to problem domains, but rather to describe the best approaches we
have found for solving problems and organizing applications using both Rails
and Backbone.
