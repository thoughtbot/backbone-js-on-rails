[NOTE]
================================================================================
This is probably the first time you'll see +_.bindAll()+, so let's pause
briefly to introduce what it is doing.

When an event is triggered, the code invoking the callback is able to set the
JavaScript context. By calling +_.bindAll(this, "error")+, we are instead
overriding whatever context it may have been, and setting it to +this+. This is
necessary so that when we call +this.$(\'form\')+ in the +error()+ callback,
we get the right object back.

Always use +_.bindAll+ when you need to force the JavaScript context (+this+)
within a function's body.
