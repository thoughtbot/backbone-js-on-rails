## Backbone online resources

This book is not an introduction, and assumes you have some knowledge of
Javascript and of Backbone.  Fortunately, there is solid documentation available
to get you up to speed on Backbone.

The online documentation for Backbone is very readable:

The GitHub wiki for Backbone links to a large number of tutorials and examples:

PeepCode has produced a three-part series on getting up to speed on Backbone:

Finally, Nick Gauthier and Chris Strom have published an ebook with several real-world
examples they have extracted from production code:
