Backbone.js on Rails Example app
================================

It's a Rails 3.2 app.

Running the app
---------------

Make sure you're running Ruby 1.9 (there's a .ruby-version file that should be
read by rvm or rbenv) and then:

    bundle
    bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate
    bundle exec rails server

Open on http://localhost:3000

Running the tests
-----------------

The first time, create the test database:

    bundle exec rake db:test:prepare

There are three sets of tests: Cucumber integration tests, RSpec isolation
specs for Rails components, and Jasmine isolation specs for Backbone
components.

Run them all at once:

    bundle exec rake

Or one at a time

    bundle exec rake cucumber
    bundle exec rake spec
    bundle exec rake jasmine:ci

To interactively run the Jasmine specs several times (for example, while
developing), run `bundle exec rake jasmine` and visit http://localhost:8888 to
view the suite.
